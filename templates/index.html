    In an effort to bring greater transparency to government spending, <i>The Baltimore Sun</i> has been committed to publishing public salary databases since 2009.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Office of the Maryland Comptroller has rounded the salaries and gross pays to the nearest thousand to prevent tax fraud attempts on state employees. As a result, some figures have been rounded down to zero.
